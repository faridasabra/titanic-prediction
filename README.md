# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the Kaggle Titanic survival prediction competition, aiming to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived based on their features.

## Project Description

The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic. Given various passenger attributes, the goal is to train a model that can learn the relationship between these features and survival, then make predictions on unseen passenger data. This is a classic classification problem where the outcome is categorical (survived or did not survive).

## Datasets

The project typically utilizes three datasets from the Kaggle competition:

* **Training set:** Used for data manipulation, analysis, and building the predictive model.
* **Test set:** Used to make predictions on unseen data, which is then assessed for model accuracy in the competition.
* **Sample submission:** Provides the required format for submitting final predictions.

## Data Features

The datasets include features such as:

* `PassengerId` (often dropped as an index)
* `Survived` (target variable in the training set)
* `Pclass` (passenger class)
* `Name`
* `Sex`
* `Age`
* `SibSp` (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
* `Parch` (number of parents/children aboard)
* `Ticket`
* `Fare`
* `Cabin`
* `Embarked` (port of embarkation)

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Key steps in the data handling process often include:

* **Combining training and test sets** for consistent data cleaning.
* **Handling missing values:**
    * `Age`: Imputed using various methodologies (e.g., mean, random numbers, or mean within subgroups based on categorical features).
    * `Embarked`: Missing values often filled with the most frequent embarkation point.
    * `Cabin`: Often dropped due to a high percentage of missing information.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Extracting `Title` from `Name`.
    * Creating `FamilySize` from `SibSp` and `Parch`.
    * Creating dummy variables (one-hot encoding) for categorical features like `Pclass`, `Sex`, and `Embarked`.
    * Dropping irrelevant columns like `PassengerId`, `Name`, and `Ticket` after feature extraction if they don't contribute directly to prediction.

## Machine Learning Models

Various machine learning algorithms are explored for classification, although specific models were not detailed in the provided search results for this particular notebook, common ones for the Titanic dataset include:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naive Bayes

## Getting Started

To run this project, you would typically:
1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install necessary Python libraries**, which often include:
    * `NumPy`
    * `Pandas`
    * `Matplotlib`
    * `Seaborn`
    * `Scikit-Learn`
    * `SciPy`
    * `IPython`
    * `StatsModels`
    * `Patsy`
3.  **Download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets** from the Kaggle Titanic competition page.
4.  **Execute the Jupyter Notebook** (e.g., `titanic.ipynb`) to perform data analysis, model building, and prediction.

**Note:** Some setups may involve creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
